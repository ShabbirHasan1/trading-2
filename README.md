# Quant Trading

For all the aspiring quant traders, here are examples of actual research code that I have written and used.  Please note
none of this code is proprietary to any particular firm but has been written for my own personal research.  Feel free to
contact me if a module is missing as I am refactoring the original code for github use and may have missed
a module.
